- 👋 Hi, I’m @sosoandso
- 👀 I’m interested in learning effectively towards becoming a software engineer oneday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course (I'm being tested truly in my level of patience during projects lol) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some of the projects in my course (As an amateur this will really help!) or things you may think might help me improve. Currently my priority is seeing my current course through.  
- 📫 How to reach me - on here! Looking forward to meeting you :)!

p.s. 1st time using this platform so bear with me!
